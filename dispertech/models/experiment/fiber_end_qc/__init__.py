This routine is used to monitor the fiber end and keep track of the images of the cartridges over time. The idea is
that we can make an image of the fiber end after cleaving (before putting into the package/vacuum), and after we put
it on the microscope again, or after we use it. This gives insight into how much does the fiber end position fluctuate,
and whether there is any process that can be damaging it over time, such as the packaging, handling, etc.
